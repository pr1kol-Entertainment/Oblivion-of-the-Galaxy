## Introduction

Oblivion of the Galaxy was made by [pr1koltv](https://www.twitch.tv/pr1koltv)

In this Modpack, you can engage in technology, roam the deep forests and fight various monsters!
Because there are such famous mods as Botania, Mekanism, Immersive Engineering and others.

To complete this modpack, you must complete the entire tab with the Oblivion of the Galaxy advancements.
And I can say that it will take you a long time to do this, because there are a lot of achievements in this modpack and almost all craftes is complicated.
